# SavourySlices

An old niche webshop project that I originally made in my second year as Web Dev student.

For an assignment I had to build a webshop, so I decided to make a Butcher Webshop. Since it was one of my first websites, the design was kinda awful lol, the code was all over the place, and my repo… well, let’s just say it maze.

Now with more experience under my belt and some new tech + learning new tech while working on this project.
