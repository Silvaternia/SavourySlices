# SavourySlices - ~~Project Plan~~


SavourySlices is an old school project of mine, which I'll be rewriting.
The old version is a mess built with HTML, JS, and TailwindCSS. So I am starting over with a new tech stack and UI

## The New Stack
- **Python**
- **Django** ( backend magic)
- **Wagtail CMS** (for the editors)

## The Plan
- **UX & Accessibility First**
- **Editor-Friendly**
- **Website performance**

## Whatâ€™s Next?
1. Set up Django & Wagtail
2. Make a new design & Improve older usable UI elements
3. Test it, break it, fix it (rinse & repeat).
5. Launch this on netlify ( Probably???).


## Basic commands:
1. Start a new project: Wagtail start [ProjectName]
2. Start a new app: python manage.py startapp [AppName]
3. To migrate: python manage.py makemigrations & python manage.py migrate
