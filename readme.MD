# WebsRookie

This is a simple webshop project built using HTML, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS.

The project has the following functionalities: adding, editing, and removing products and you can manage your shopping cart.

The project is currently in progres. I added my assignment version to GitHub. Starting from November 12, 2024, I will focus on improving the project by:

   - Refactoring my code
   - Improving the UX and UI
   - Adding Node.js for back end
